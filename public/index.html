It will use transcripts from my 1:1 coaching calls where we go over their real estate business and talk about ways to grow them. Clients will come into these calls sometimes talking about specific properties they are selling and sometimes they will talk about hurdles they are facing. The calls are usually 25-30 minutes long and held on zoom. On these calls there is 1 coach and 1 client. The calls will start conversationally with some small talk and then the coach will usually ask about some wins the client had the past week, then go onto some goals the client has for the following week, and then move onto the specific properties, operational challenges or any other specific problem they may have. Sometimes these calls turn into more personal help from the coaches, and sometimes they are very business focused. Sometimes they talk about social media strategies, or different CRMs, or different cloud services.
Make it as diverse as possible, including different genders and races as well but try to keep everyone following one "brand image" coaches and clients are diverse but coaches are trained to follow a certain vision and guidelines. Try to cover as many different real state topics (including problematic issues that people might normally talk about in human-to-human conversations). Also try to cover as many locations as possible but keep it within the U.S.
Can you help me create dummy transcripts, with names, locations, and specifics that people would normally talk about on a conversation, also generate transcripts that would be follow ups to one another, ideally these calls take place weekly between a particular client/coach combo so do 4 session series for at least 4 coach/client combos (12 total). I need to generate at least 60 total transcripts including the follow up series. I will submit a sample dummy transcript already generated by a model.

Export as separate .md files in a zipped folder please. Make the naming convention for each .md file (coachname_clientname_date). We want to test our PII redaction tools for this. so, we want dummy transcripts to test on so we don't put any client data at risk for now. Make sure the transcripts include 25ish minutes of conversation between the client and coach. It's okay if it takes longer or you have to do the zip file in batches

Format them as markdown files so that they follow the following format:

Fill out names where they should go
